# Data Analyst Portfolio Repository

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio Repository! This collection of projects showcases my data analysis and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) skills developed across my professional journey and educational endeavors. Each project demonstrates my proficiency in ETL processes, as well as my ability to gather, clean, analyze, and visualize data to extract valuable insights and inform decision-making.

## About Me

I am a dedicated and experienced data analyst with a passion for turning raw data into meaningful narratives. Over the years, I've honed my skills in data manipulation, statistical analysis, data visualization, and communication of results. This repository is a reflection of my journey and growth in the field of data analysis.

I've spent over 8 years at ADP, working in the Pay Card product division. While my title is Senior Accountant, my responsibilities align more with those of a data analyst. The pay card product allows ADP's clients to facilitate payroll to their employees using pay cards. This involves extensive financial data analysis, including data extraction, cleaning, organization, and the creation of data models to identify trends, make forecasts, run scenario analyses, and report findings to senior leadership. I leverage tools like Tableau, SQL, SAP, and Excel for these tasks.

During my MBA, where I specialized in Business Analytics, I had the privilege of refining my strategic and analytical skills. I worked on projects involving advanced statistical analysis, forecasting, data mining, and machine learning techniques. Notably, one of my favorite courses was Decision Modeling, where I developed models incorporating linear programming, network models, and project management. For instance, I designed a cost-minimization model for a pharmaceutical company facing supply constraints, various production processes, and production quotas, and conducted sensitivity analyses on the model's outputs.


## Projects Overview

In this repository, you'll find a diverse range of data analysis projects, each focusing on different aspects of data exploration and interpretation. From exploratory data analysis to predictive modeling, my projects underscore my proficiency across various tools and platforms including SQL Server, Python, R, Tableau, and more.

Feel free to explore the projects that interest you the most, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or feedback. Whether you're a fellow data enthusiast, a potential collaborator, or someone interested in my data analysis skills, I hope you find this portfolio informative and insightful.

- **Data Cleaning, Preprocessing, and ETL:** Proficient in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, I demonstrate the ability to handle messy and incomplete data, ensuring its quality and reliability for analysis. This includes extracting relevant data, transforming it into usable formats, and loading it into databases. Additionally, I excel in creating and optimizing databases, and I'm skilled in querying data using tools like SQL Server. This expertise allows me to effectively manage data transformation, ensuring efficient data retrieval and analysis.

- **Descriptive and Inferential Statistics:** Showcasing my skills in extracting meaningful insights from data through statistical techniques, hypothesis testing, and trend identification.

- **Data Visualization:** Displaying my capability to create informative visual representations that effectively communicate data-driven insights to a wider audience.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Highlighting my expertise in uncovering patterns, relationships, and anomalies within datasets to guide further analysis.

- **Predictive Modeling:** Demonstrating how I utilize machine learning techniques to build predictive models that can aid in forecasting and decision-making.

## Repository Structure

Each project is contained in its own directory within this repository. In each project directory, you'll find detailed documentation and code that walk you through the entire data analysis process. This includes data sourcing, data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, modeling (if applicable), and the final insights derived from the project.

Feel free to explore the projects that interest you the most, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or feedback. Whether you're a fellow data enthusiast, a potential collaborator, or someone interested in my data analysis skills, I hope you find this portfolio informative and insightful.
